<p>Become the master of the game.</p>
<p>The game is a board game, turn based, for 2 players, and 5 bead each one. The objective of the game is to own as much from the board as possible, using the beads to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game is based on the teachings of Hermann Hesse and The Glass Bead Game (Das Glasperlenspiel).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Glass Bead Game is "a kind of synthesis of human learning" in which themes, such music, philosophical thought, and mathematics are stated, together with the elements basic of the world, such as Fire, Wind, Water, and Soil.</p>
